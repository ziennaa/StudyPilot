StudyPilot processes page text locally on your computer using Chromeâ€™s on-device models.
We do not collect, transmit, or store personal data. No analytics, no servers.
Permissions used:
- activeTab, scripting: read page text to summarize on demand
- sidePanel, storage, contextMenus: UI and your settings
- <all_urls> host permissions: to run on pages you open (still local)
